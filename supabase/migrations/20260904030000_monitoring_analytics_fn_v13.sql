-- v13: adds result-count-weighted `credits` to places_api_by_endpoint and
-- places_api_calls_by_day_and_endpoint, using places_api_call_credits()
-- (20260904020000_places_api_call_log_result_count.sql) instead of letting
-- the web app estimate credits from a flat per-endpoint constant. Only
-- successful calls are weighted (filter (where success)), matching
-- get_places_api_day_to_date_counts' existing "and success" assumption that
-- failed requests aren't billed by Geoapify -- count/error_count are
-- unchanged and still reflect every attempted call.
