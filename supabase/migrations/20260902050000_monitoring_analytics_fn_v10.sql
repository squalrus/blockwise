-- v10: the Monitoring tab's range control gains 5-minute and 1-hour
-- options alongside the existing 24h/7d/30d (so a live incident can be
-- watched at near-real-time granularity, not just day-level), which needs
-- sub-day precision the old p_days int couldn't express. Replaces p_days
-- with p_minutes throughout -- every "since" filter now computes
-- `now() - (p_minutes || ' minutes')::interval` instead of `... days`,
-- and the echoed window comes back as `window_minutes` instead of `days`.
-- The *_over_time series stay bucketed by date_trunc('day', ...) even for
-- the new short windows -- a 5-minute window still returns at most one
-- day's bucket, which reads as a single point rather than a real trend
-- line, but recent_errors/recent_requests (this tab's actual "what's
-- happening right now" view) already work fine at any window size, and
-- hour/minute-level bucketing is a bigger change left for if it's ever
-- actually needed.

-- CREATE OR REPLACE can't rename an existing parameter (p_days ->
-- p_minutes) in place -- Postgres errors with "cannot change name of input
-- parameter" -- so the old signature has to be dropped first.
