Living inventory of every route in `apps/web` and every endpoint in `apps/api`. This is **not** a point-in-time snapshot — keep it current.

## Web app (`apps/web/src/app`, Next.js App Router)

Legend: **P** = public, no auth · **C** = client-side auth check only (soft) · **S** = server-enforced auth (hard gate on the API calls the page makes)

Identifier note: neighborhoods are addressed by **slug** everywhere in the web app now (`/neighborhoods/:slug`, `/neighborhood-admin/:slug`); venues are addressed by **id** (UUID) everywhere (`/venues/:id`, `/business/:venueId`).

## API (`apps/api/src/app.ts`)

Auth gates:

- **public** — no auth, or `attachOptionalAuthUser` (personalizes response if a token is present, never blocks)
- **auth** — `requireAuthUser` (any signed-in account)
- **business** — `requireBusinessAccount` (signed in + `account_type = 'business'`)
- **venueOwner** — `requireVenueOwner` (approved claim on the venue at `:id`)
- **admin** — `requireAdmin` (admin of *at least one* neighborhood, no `:id` to scope by — list-style routes only)
- **neighborhoodAdmin** — `requireNeighborhoodAdmin` (admin of the *specific* neighborhood at `:id`)

Identifier note: every neighborhood-identifying path param in the API is the **id** (UUID), except the public `GET /neighborhoods/:slug` family (profile, leaderboard, challenges) — the web app resolves slug→id client-side (via `GET /neighborhood-admin/neighborhoods`) before calling any `:id`-keyed admin route. Venue-identifying params are always **id** (UUID), never slug.

## History

- **2026-07-07** — Business claim review and venue-category reassignment folded from global `/admin/claims`/`/admin/venues` (gated only by "admin of *some* neighborhood," no per-neighborhood filter) into `/neighborhood-admin/neighborhoods/:id/{claims,venues}` (properly `neighborhoodAdminGate`-scoped). Web URLs switched from the neighborhood's UUID to its slug (`/neighborhood-admin/[neighborhoodId]` → `/neighborhood-admin/[neighborhoodSlug]`), with a shared `layout.tsx` adding a secondary tab nav (Overview / Business claims / Venue categories). See `CHANGELOG.md`.
